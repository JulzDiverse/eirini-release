## Deploy Eirini-Release

### Prereq's

Make sure to have the following tools deployed to your local machine:

- [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) 
- [Bosh (v2) CLI](https://bosh.io/docs/cli-v2-install/)
- [CF CLI](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html)
- [minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube#installation)
- [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
- Ruby ( v > 2.4:`capi-release` still uses pre-packaging)

### Deploying 

Download the `eirini-release` and execute `$eirini-release/scripts/lite/deploy-eirini-lite.sh` script:

```
$ ~/workspace/eirini-release/scripts/lite/come-on-eirini.sh
```

This script will create a `eirini-lite` folder in your `$HOME/workspace` directory, download all necessary repositories and setup bosh-lite, minikube, plus eirini on your local machine. Moreover it will setup a `eirini` org and `dev` space on CF, such that you are ready to push some `dora` apps right after the script finished its work (which takes a while). 

If you want to do things manually or have a running Bosh-Lite and CF, you can take a look at our script `scripts/lite/setup-eirini-environment.sh`. It is well written and documented. Each required step is a separate function (they contain the commands that needs to be executed for the particular step) and the `main` tells you the order of the required steps.
